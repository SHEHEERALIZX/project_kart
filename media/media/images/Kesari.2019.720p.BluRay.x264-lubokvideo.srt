00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,210
At the beginning of the 19th century,
Maharaja Ranjit Singh drove away

3
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,540
the Afghans from the North-Western region
of India and established Sikh Rule there.

4
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,670
Since then,
the Prince of Afghanistan kept looking out

5
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,370
for an opportunity to capture
this part of India again.

6
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,480
After the Maharaja's death,

7
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,160
when the British tried to
strengthen their hold on the region,

8
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,710
they suffered heavy losses
at the hands of the Afghan tribes.

9
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,530
It was also said that
there was a Mullah...

10
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,400
who would incite the Pathans to
attack the British in the name of Jihad.

11
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,770
Since it was only the Sikhs
who could oust the Afghans,

12
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,200
the British took the help of the
Sikh Armed Forces to fight the invaders.

13
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,500
In 1890, the 36th Sikh regiment
was stationed at the three forts built...

14
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,690
amidst the Samana Mountains.

15
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,440
This is the story of the
soldiers from this very regiment,

16
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,810
who were guarding the Saragarhi Fort.

17
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,230
These mountains fall under Afghanistan.

18
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,940
And these belong to India.

19
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,080
And in the middle, a line is drawn.

20
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,230
And proclaimed as a border.

21
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,230
- This?
- Hmm.

22
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,890
Now let's suppose,
the Englishman is the husband...

23
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,390
And the Ruler of
Afghanistan is the wife...

24
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,770
And the Pathans of this
region are the Magistrate.

25
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,020
The wife took the husband's money...

26
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,970
And accepted this line as the border.

27
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,930
So if the husband and
wife are in agreement...

28
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,600
what's the magistrate's problem?

29
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,790
The magistrate always
has a grouse with the regime.

30
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,350
On top of that,
the wife keeps egging him on...

31
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,560
So the Afghan Prince is instigating
the Pathans against the British...

32
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
But why?

33
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,310
Because the wife wants
to continue her Russian affair...

34
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,930
divorce the husband
and grab the alimony!

35
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,930
And only the magistrate
can sanction the divorce.

36
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,860
Ishar Singh...

37
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,480
But if the Prince is the wife,

38
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,180
The Englishman is the husband...

39
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,060
And the Russian is the lover...

40
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,480
Who are we, then?

41
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,860
The wedding guests!

42
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Gulab Singh, we're the wedding procession.

43
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,480
We're just here to dance to their tunes!

44
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,660
Havaldar (Sergeant) Ishar Singh!

45
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,690
Yes Sir.

46
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,690
We're done patrolling today.

47
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,390
Time to head back to Gulistan.

48
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Keep the men ready.

49
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Yes Sir.

50
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,180
- Sir, look!
- No, Ishar Singh!

51
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,270
We won't interfere in their matters.

52
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,730
- Sir, they'll kill her!
- So what?

53
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,520
It's business as usual for them.

54
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,390
Not our problem.

55
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,020
Come on, move!

56
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,730
That's an order, Havaldar!

57
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,560
Havaldar!

58
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,930
Lord Almighty, uphold our honour.

59
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Oh dear.

60
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,190
It's showtime!

61
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Run...

62
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Run away!

63
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,680
The Sikhs carry their
honour in their turbans...

64
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,770
Take it off first.

65
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,350
Strip his head bare
before you chop it off.

66
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,560
Kill me if you want,

67
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,010
but don't dare touch my turban.

68
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:41,430
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

69
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,100
He needs to be punished severely, Sir.

70
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,130
We need to set an example.

71
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,560
You are right, Lawrence.

72
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,350
This is a serious matter.

73
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,930
We must inform the Lieutenant
Colonel immediately.

74
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,520
- Attar Singh!
- Yes Sir!

75
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,100
Make contact with Saragarhi.

76
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,700
We need to send a message to Lockhart.

77
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,810
For Lieutenant Colonel Haughton.

78
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,890
Yes Sir!

79
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,180
Water is already scarce.

80
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,520
If the Major finds out you've
been watering the earth it,

81
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,350
he'll shoot you straight-away.

82
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,480
It's my share of water.

83
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,810
Whether I drink it or throw it -

84
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,520
my wish!

85
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,730
Any progress?

86
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,980
Not yet.

87
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,100
Nothing can grow here, Ishar...

88
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,770
This soil is as hostile as the Pathans...

89
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,730
It refuses to mingle with strangers.

90
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,930
I'm a farmer, Gulaab...

91
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,180
Bonding with the earth
comes naturally to me.

92
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,770
So, have they decided on my punishment?

93
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,390
Not yet...

94
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,310
He'll poison the Major's ears first...

95
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,430
Then they'll send word to Haughton Sir.

96
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,640
He's going to deal with you then.

97
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,520
Haughton Sir won't do anything to me.

98
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,270
He's very different from Lawrence Sir.

99
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
How exactly?

100
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,640
Haughton Sir doesn't discriminate
on the basis of a man's colour.

101
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,480
Right.

102
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,130
Whether you're white, brown or any colour

103
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,690
for him, all soldiers are equal.

104
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,390
All that is rubbish.

105
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,490
If that were the case, why would
he differentiate between you and I?

106
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,790
Because we're separated by rank.

107
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,700
That's why.

108
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,730
Man, I want to rise in rank too!

109
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,100
Learn some English first, Gulabo!

110
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,230
Yeah right...

111
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,930
As if you've learnt a lot, eh?

112
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,600
I have! By listening to them.

113
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,560
You barely know a few words...

114
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,320
God knows if you even use them correctly!

115
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,180
I know a lot of words.

116
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,980
I learn a new one everyday.

117
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,600
Right.

118
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,640
Do you remember the day when troops
arrived from Hangu... With General Biggs?

119
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,500
Yes.

120
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,320
Among them was a British
Havaldar (Sergeant).

121
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,470
- Yeah, yeah.
- The same rank.

122
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,800
Do you know what they called him?

123
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,640
What?

124
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,680
"Saajan (Darling) Tim, Saajan Tim!"

125
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,430
- Saajan?
- Hmm!

126
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,060
God, no...

127
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,360
I don't want to be a Havaldar then!

128
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,770
Why, what happened?

129
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,180
Look, there are 175 men here.

130
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,640
If they all start calling
me 'Darling Gulaab'...

131
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,600
My masculinity will be blown to bits!

132
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,680
Well, Nurse Teresa will
call you 'Darling' too, then...

133
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,600
Won't you be thrilled!

134
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,430
Oh stop it, Ishar Singh!

135
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,890
What do I say, my friend...

136
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,310
Every time a war begins...

137
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,180
I wish to get injured...

138
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,600
Only so the pretty nurse
could tend to my wounds.

139
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,010
But nothing ever happens!

140
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,810
The Pathans can't even aim -

141
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,390
Gulabo!

142
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,230
Nurse!

143
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,270
Look after him.

144
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,640
There's too many of them, Sir!

145
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,230
Send word to Lockhart.

146
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,640
Call for help. Quick!

147
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,730
Yes Sir!

148
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Buddy..

149
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,970
Why didn't you obey
Lieutenant Lawrence's orders?

150
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,310
If I had,
that girl would have been killed.

151
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,770
Yes, she would've died...

152
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,430
But we wouldn't have been attacked!

153
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,890
You just gave that
Mullah another excuse...

154
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,100
To rile up the Pathans against us.

155
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,430
I beg your pardon, Sir...

156
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,390
But the reason behind this war isn't me...

157
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,230
It's the British government.

158
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,390
Don't you dare teach me about
the politics of my government.

159
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,020
You're a soldier,
meddling in politics isn't your job.

160
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,770
Your job is to follow orders.

161
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,810
I'm transferring you.

162
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,730
You're going to Saragarhi
and taking charge there tomorrow.

163
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,350
Sir, what will I do there?

164
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,700
Nothing ever happens there.

165
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,350
Yes. That's why.

166
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,740
So you won't get into trouble over there.

167
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,350
And remember.

168
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,860
Without Saragarhi,
Gulistan and Lockhart can't communicate.

169
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,980
I'm a soldier, Sir...

170
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,560
Not a postman.

171
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,730
Be careful Ishar Singh,
or you won't remain a postman either.

172
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,770
Havaldar!

173
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
Havaldar!

174
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,480
Yes Sir.

175
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,570
When you see a senior officer,
what are you supposed to do?

176
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,440
I didn't ask you to salute.

177
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,600
I simply asked you -

178
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,020
what should you do when you see me?

179
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,150
I should salute you, Sir.

180
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,440
Then why didn't you?

181
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
I see.

182
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,980
Looks like I need to teach
you some discipline, Havaldar.

183
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,150
Now salute thrice.

184
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,230
And with each salute,
apologize to your senior officer.

185
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,900
Right now, Havaldar!

186
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm sorry, Sir.

187
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,230
I'm sorry, Sir.

188
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,520
I'm sorry, Sir.

189
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,940
What did you think, Havaldar?

190
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,150
You'll disobey me and get away with it?

191
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,160
You think you're better than me, isn't it?

192
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,860
Well, let me tell you something.

193
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,690
If you were better than us...

194
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,200
You wouldn't be our slaves.

195
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,860
You know, it's funny.

196
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,070
The Sikhs and Pathans
claim to be very brave...

197
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,190
But the moment there's a chance,
you're the first to flee.

198
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,400
Like now...

199
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,360
You're running off to Saragarhi.

200
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,940
That's how the people of India are.

201
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,930
I think there's something
rotten in this land itself...

202
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,110
It breeds cowardice.

203
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,520
Am I right, Havaldar?

204
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,440
I'm sorry. Don't let me keep you.

205
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,690
You need to pack your bags.

206
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,400
So long, f***er!

207
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,110
'Fakhar' (Pride)?

208
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,230
On one hand, he's angry...

209
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,940
And yet, he's proud of you too?

210
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,420
I'm confused.

211
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,820
These Britishers are such weirdos, man!

212
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,480
He says the cowards are
born from the land of our country.

213
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,400
These forts stand on our shoulders...

214
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,230
And they have the gall to call us cowards,
the low-lives!

215
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,390
Why didn't you answer back?

216
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,190
I don't know why...

217
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,440
Words seemed to fall short.

218
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,150
Man, don't you ever wish...

219
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,150
We could flow free, like a river...

220
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,820
Walk with pride and swagger...

221
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,110
March to our own beat?

222
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,900
What are you talking about, Ishar?

223
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,440
I don't really understand.

224
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,980
Today, for the first time I realized...

225
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,900
We're slaves, not soldiers.

226
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,190
Were people like us just

227
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,190
born to bow and salute?

228
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,610
First the Mughals ruled us,

229
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,480
now the British...

230
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,020
When will we rule ourselves?

231
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,020
So you want to rule, is it?

232
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,070
I want to be free...

233
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,020
To be free like a river...

234
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,190
To flow of my own accord.

235
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,690
Anyway, forget that.

236
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Tell me something...

237
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,970
Did she finally nurse your wounds?

238
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,770
How would I know -

239
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,020
I was unconscious!

240
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,980
My luck is cursed.

241
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,190
I took a bullet, all in vain!

242
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,440
Why don't you get married?

243
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,900
I will when I go back to my village next.

244
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,860
It's better than getting
shot for a random woman...

245
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,190
I'll just remember my wife,
and soothe my heart.

246
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,610
Like you do.

247
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,420
What do you mean?

248
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,150
Don't act so innocent...

249
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,620
I've often seen you sitting and
thinking of her, smiling to yourself.

250
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,320
You sure keep an eye on me, eh!

251
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,400
Very well. I'll leave now.

252
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,860
Stay strong, my friend.

253
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,230
Take care of yourself.

254
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,240
Holy smokes!

255
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,940
It's you!

256
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,940
I thought it's someone else.

257
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,680
Hello.

258
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,320
Hello.

259
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,610
Are you fine, ma'am?

260
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,990
I hope nobody troubled you again?

261
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,820
Do you understand what I'm saying?

262
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,020
Do you know Punjabi?

263
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,070
Hindustani?

264
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,900
No point asking.

265
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,300
Do you know English, ma'am?

266
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,600
Engli...

267
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,970
One-two-three,
left-right, left-right, fire, line...

268
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,050
Bye-bye...

269
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,150
Bye-bye!

270
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,320
Wow... 'bye-bye'?

271
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,150
By God, you speak English!

272
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,730
Amazing.

273
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,050
Do you know any more?

274
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,650
No?

275
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,730
Very well. I'll be off then.

276
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Pardon?

277
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,040
Yes, yes.

278
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,710
What is this?

279
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,900
Hmm... It's sweet.

280
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,610
It's very tasty.

281
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,630
It was nice talking to you.

282
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,110
I'll be off now. May God be with you.

283
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Bye bye.

284
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,570
Are you done philandering?

285
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,920
Bless you, my love!

286
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,610
Such anger!

287
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,150
I look after your home,
await your return years on end...

288
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,320
While you get cozy with that Pathani!

289
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,280
Why fight as soon as you've arrived, love?

290
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,650
At least offer me a few sweet words!

291
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,320
You satisfied your sweet tooth,
didn't you? Tell me!

292
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,730
I'm going to crush your bones.

293
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,610
Wait till you get home.

294
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,820
She offered me sweets
as a token of gratitude...

295
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,630
So I had to accept it.

296
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,860
You know I'm not fond of sweets anyway...

297
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,980
I like it hot and spicy...

298
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,900
That's why I married you!

299
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,420
You're not all that good looking,
you know...

300
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,170
It's just these silly things
you say that make me fall for you.

301
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,240
So when I come home,
will you just crush my bones...

302
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,760
Or will we get cozy too?

303
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,860
I say, Mister Ishar Singh...

304
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,440
Yes, sweetheart...

305
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,020
Go to hell.

306
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,340
Okay, forget romance...
At least give me a hug!

307
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,360
I'll die a happy man!

308
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,000
My love!

309
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,560

343
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,150
So should I write this, then?

344
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,820
"I miss you a lot."

345
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,360
Oh no. Let it be, Gurmukh.

346
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,690
She'll have the priest read it to her.

347
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,230
If she hears these words from him...

348
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,520
she'll be mortified, the poor thing!

349
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,610
Just write this much, that I'll -

350
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,440
It's a letter from Haughton Sir.

351
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,190
I'm taking charge
of this place from today.

352
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,330
But weren't you going to arrive tomorrow?

353
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,240
I'm Naik (Corporal) Lal Singh
and that's Sepoy Gurmukh Singh.

354
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,560
Lamp Operator.

355
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,030
So you have kids enrolled in the army!

356
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,350
How old are you, kiddo?

357
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,530
Nineteen, Sir.

358
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,530
Who's making so much noise?

359
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,410
Attention!

360
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,030
Attention!

361
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,870
Attention, soldiers!

362
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,020
Havaldar Ishar Singh
is here to take charge.

363
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,990
Sir, water.

364
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,950
Who are you?

365
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,780
I'm the cook. Khuda Daad.

366
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,330
No thanks.

367
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,220
So these are the brave
men of the 36th Sikh cavalry.

368
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,700
Is this what soldiers are like?

369
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,010
No Sir.

370
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,290
Actually,
nothing much happens around here...

371
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,000
All we do is pass on messages
from Gulistan to Lockhart...

372
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,660
Back and forth.

373
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,320
You could say it's like a post office.

374
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,910
This is the army, Lal Singh.

375
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,180
Not a festive carnival!

376
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,450
Look at the state of your men!

377
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,240
Where's your uniform?

378
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,910
Worthless creatures!

379
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,870
Drop the broom!

380
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
Look.

381
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,160
A soldier in underwear!

382
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,870
Look at Gurmukh!

383
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,250
A soldier must be in uniform on duty!

384
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,870
Bloody Brit!

385
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,530
You'll be punished for this.

386
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,620
Now you'll wrestle among yourselves,
and the roosters will watch the show!

387
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,120
And you'll continue
till the roosters ask you to stop.

388
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
But...

389
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,920
How will the roosters speak?

390
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,470
Who are you?

391
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,760
Lance Naik Chanda Singh, Sir!

392
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,510
Chanda Singh...

393
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,870
While they wrestle,

394
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,430
you'll take rounds of the fort.

395
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Understood?

396
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,530
Yes Sir.

397
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
Lal Singh.

398
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,130
Yes Sir.

399
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,450
Your duty is

400
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,080
to keep a watch on them.

401
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,160
If anything goes wrong in the slightest,

402
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,780
you'll be punished.

403
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,870
Yes Sir.

404
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,330
And remember

405
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,920
you'll only do as the roosters say.

406
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,560
Get the birds!

407
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,460
You went on a rampage as soon as
you arrived! Why were you so hard on them?

408
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,040
My love...

409
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,580
This regiment was named after the Sikhs.

410
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,750
Its name carries our repute and honour.

411
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,210
One mistake from them can
malign not just the regiment...

412
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,870
But the name of our entire community.

413
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,250
But the roosters won't speak, will they?

414
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,210
They won't.

415
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,920
So then?

416
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,290
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

417
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:50,330
Adversity reveals one's
true character, isn't it?

418
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,000
What is it?

419
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,290
When you say such clever things,

420
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,000
I feel so...

421
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,170
Don't you have any work to do?

422
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
Go, feed the cattle!

423
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,500
I've already fed them.

424
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,370
I just need to feed your mother now.

425
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,210
Don't talk nonsense.

426
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,580
Do you want a spanking?

427
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,790
Oooh...

428
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,500
Go right ahead, my love!

429
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,920
At least you'll touch me then.

430
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,250
Hush, you naughty girl!

431
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,290
What's happening?

432
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,830
I asked them to wrestle
and they're singing instead.

433
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,960
Lal Singh!

434
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
Yes Sir.

435
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,680
Where are the roosters?

436
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,420
We cooked them, Sir.

437
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,090
On whose orders?

438
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,620
The roosters' orders!

439
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,290
What nonsense is this?

440
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,500
Sir, you told us to
do as the roosters say.

441
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,420
They didn't say 'Stop!',
but they definitely told us to cook.

442
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
They spoke to you?

443
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,420
That's what,
at first we didn't understand either.

444
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,080
They were speaking in English, Sir!

445
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,040
The roosters spoke in English?

446
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
Yes Sir.

447
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,710
Jeevan Singh!

448
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,960
Tell Sir what they said.

449
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,420
Sir, among all of us,
only Gurmukh knows English.

450
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,650
He told us what 'Cook'
means in English, so...

451
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,990
We did exactly that, Sir.

452
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,790
Who was responsible for carrying
out the punishment properly, Lal Singh?

453
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,920
I was, Sir.

454
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,550
So then you'll be one getting punished.

455
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,210
Forget chicken,
you'll get nothing to eat for a week.

456
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,390
Yes Sir.

457
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,330
Pardon me, Sir...

458
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,380
But as long as Naik Lal Singh doesn't eat,
we won't either.

459
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,960
Alright.

460
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,790
Actually, let's extend
the punishment to two weeks.

461
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,670
Okay?

462
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,330
Two weeks, Sir?

463
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Should I increase it?

464
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
Any doubts?

465
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,950
No, Sir!

466
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,410
36th Sikh Regiment, any doubts?

467
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,290
No, Sir!

468
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,170
Well done.

469
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,420
"Cook-a-doodle doo!"

470
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,420
There he goes again!

471
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,410
Man, if he couldn't get married...

472
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,120
How is it our fault?

473
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,540
Well, if a man gets called to the battlefield
right before his wedding night...

474
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,750
He's bound to be upset.

475
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,120
Poor guy's stuck being a virgin...

476
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,530
Yeah, as if you have tons of experience!

477
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,400
O Bholeya!

478
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,170
What's the only battle you can never win?

479
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,790
Do you know? Tell me?

480
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,210
Marriage!

481
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,540
No matter what you do,
the wife always wins!

482
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,210
Lighten up, man...

483
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,080
I told you, he won't laugh.

484
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,420
He will, someday!

485
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,830
Took rounds of the fort all night...

486
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,080
Didn't sleep, and wouldn't let us either!

487
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,330
Not sure if he's a man or a bloody ghost.

488
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,890
Definitely a ghost!

489
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,120
Give it a break, man!

490
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,740
Polish that shoe any more,
and a Genie will emerge from it!

491
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,740
You won't understand, Ram!

492
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,150
I know...

493
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,740
You're saving them for your father.

494
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,150
These aren't just shoes,
they're my father's dream.

495
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,740
The poor man has worn one pair of
torn slippers all his life.

496
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,240
He always loved the shoes soldiers wear...

497
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,610
That's why he enrolled me in the army!

498
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,280
Now when I take these
gleaming shoes for him...

499
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,860
You'll see.

500
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,570
He'll be so happy,
he'll even wear them to sleep!

501
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,690
Weirdo!

502
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,030
What's with him and our undies?

503
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,740
Bholeya!

504
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,400
Shall I tell you a joke?

505
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,070
Once, a...

506
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,430
Lighten up, man...

507
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,180
What does he think of himself?

508
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,070
What kind of punishment is this?

509
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,440
If a soldier remains hungry,
how will he fight?

510
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,820
Sir, I don't get a good
feeling about this man.

511
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,650
The British have sent us a liability.

512
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,070
Mark my words.
This man will get us killed one day.

513
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,440
We were at fault, Chanda.

514
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,030
We deserved to be punished.

515
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,940
Don't get so angry.

516
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,370
Let it go.

517
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,900
Look at this.

518
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:28,610
Look, your niece is now six months old!

519
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,860
See!

520
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,360
She has such tiny hands!

521
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:42,650
Man... Enough, for God's sake!

522
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,910
Stop playing these morose tunes now.

523
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,990
Come, spend your wedding
night with me if you want!

524
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,320
Have you lost it!

525
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,150
Gentlemen...

526
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:16,010
Till now, each of your tribes
have fought the British separately...

527
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,760
Which is why they have failed.

528
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,550
But now it's time to stand united.

529
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,480
Because now,
it's not merely a border-related matter.

530
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:32,240
Some days ago, that Britisher
along with his Sikh infidels

531
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,130
stopped us from punishing
a woman who insulted Allah's name.

532
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,510
Blasphemy!

533
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:47,000
The day is not far, when they'll
tell us to let our women roam unveiled...

534
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,050
The way their women do. God forbid!

535
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,470
There's still time...

536
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:03,880
We need to protect our women,

537
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,960
our traditions, our faith...

538
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:13,380
We have to destroy
them or we'll be destroyed.

539
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,410
We...

540
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,180
We need to fight a holy war...

541
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,840
Jihad.

542
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,680
I agree that we must stand united,
Mullah Saeedullah...

543
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,800
But before making any decision,
I want to know where the Sheikh is?

544
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,550
Sheikh Abdul Rehman is
the Ruler of Afghanistan...

545
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,710
The British always keep an eye on him,

546
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,740
so it wasn't possible
for him to be here today.

547
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,540
We have no problem with his absence.

548
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,630
Our only issue is that
the British pay us money...

549
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,630
To not attack their convoys.
What about that?

550
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,380
If we succeed,
you'll get double the amount.

551
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,750
And the border?

552
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,300
It'll be erased.

553
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,090
It's a deal.

554
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:20,610
8, 9, 10...

555
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,880
11, 12,13, 14...

556
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,180
Do you know,

557
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,090
the pantry has 312 potatoes,

558
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,260
221 onions and 150 carrots...

559
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,800
And a sack of watermelons.

560
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,010
How many tomatoes?

561
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,090
How does it matter?

562
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,300
It's not even been two days...

563
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,680
Yes, Khuda Daad...

564
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,260
You called me, Sir?

565
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,560
Listen...

566
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,540
Make food for everyone.

567
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,090
The punishment is over.

568
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,090
Yes Sir!

569
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,220
Everyone get ready to eat!

570
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,130
Sir has called off the punishment!

571
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,220
Hold on!

572
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,680
No one's going to eat.

573
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,760
Sir, we're going to
complete the punishment.

574
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,730
The punishment is over, Chanda.

575
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,720
Come quietly and eat.

576
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,800
No Sir.

577
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,470
We don't need his pity.

578
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,130
Two weeks means two weeks.

579
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,090
Understood?

580
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,630
You are wise men.

581
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,090
You must have a good reason to rebel.

582
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,130
But you must know that.

583
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,080
Sir hasn't eaten in two days as well.

584
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:24,130
Sir, why are you punishing yourself?

585
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:31,130
To eat while my comrades stay hungry?

586
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,470
I'm not such a soldier, Lal Singh.

587
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,130
Alright, Sir.

588
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,180
Let's all eat together, then.

589
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,800
Khuda Daad!

590
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,010
Yes Sir.

591
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,570
Go on, 'cook' the chicken!

592
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,300
Yes Sir.

593
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,760
And make it quick.

594
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,600
So it's decided then.

595
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,240
The first attack will be on Saragarhi.

596
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,730
The Sikh troops are
few in number over there.

597
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,020
Won't take much time to finish them off.

598
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:40,480
And then Gulistan and Lockhart...

599
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:45,440
won't be able to contact
each other for help.

600
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,270
And by evening,

601
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:56,150
our flag will be flying
on all three forts.

602
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:59,720
What if other troops
come to Saragarhi's rescue?

603
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,480
Our army will stop them.

604
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,560
The large British forces from
Hangu will also surely come to help them.

605
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,870
It will be difficult to stop them.

606
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:11,270
They'll only be able to
reach the next day from Hangu.

607
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,560
That's why it's imperative that we seize
control of Gulistan and Lockhart by evening.

608
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,350
Once we do that,
no army will be able to drive us out.

609
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,560
With Allah's will, it will happen.

610
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,390
This time, both the numbers
and God are in our favour.

611
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:29,150
Why do you keep getting God into this?

612
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,310
What does He have to do
with human war and bloodshed?

613
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,600
Wars aren't fought without weapons...

614
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,560
You use yours...

615
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,230
And let me use mine?

616
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,040
Sir, 'Fakhar'?

617
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,460
Your English is pretty good...

618
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,500
You must know what it means!

619
01:00:58,820 --> 01:00:59,680
Pick that up too.

620
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,170
Sir, at first I didn't understand either.

621
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:05,330
I heard the word for
the first time in Peshawar.

622
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,580
From an English officer.

623
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,580
He told me what it means.

624
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,800
Skip the long story and come to the point.

625
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,510
Tell me what it means!

626
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,100
Ishar Singh!

627
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:38,790
What in God's name is he doing?

628
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,750
Bloody Lawrence!

629
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,380
You're a Fakhar!

630
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,980
Your Dad's a Fakhar!

631
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,620
Your Brother's a Fakhar!

632
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,780
Your whole goddamn family are Fakhars!

633
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,860
Sir...

634
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,540
- Scoundrel!
- Sir...

635
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,960
- Son of a donkey!
- Sir...

636
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,190
What is it?

637
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,400
- What is it?
- Sir...

638
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,660
Sir, if you go towards
the northern wall and shout,

639
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,170
you'll be heard in Gulistan.

640
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,540
Sound echoes in all directions from there.

641
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,930
What are you looking at?

642
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,210
You go and do your work.

643
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,270
Actually, that's what I came for, Sir.

644
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:25,290
Tell me.

645
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,210
We have an informer
in the village down there.

646
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,580
He hasn't come back in a while.

647
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,270
Something seems wrong, Sir.

648
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,710
We should go and find out.

649
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,170
Welcome!

650
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,830
Please come in.

651
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,290
Thank you.

652
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,120
How may I serve you?

653
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,540
I'd like some tea, please.

654
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,080
Surely, sir!

655
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,210
Mohsin left the village overnight.

656
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:24,460
Why?

657
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:27,500
Everyone found out that he's an informer.

658
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,420
His life was under threat.

659
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,170
Where are all the
villagers carrying stones?

660
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,500
Winter is coming, Sir...

661
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:42,630
We need to finish all the village
repairs before it begins to snow.

662
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,500
But I only see women,
children and elderly folk...

663
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,170
This is heavy labour...

664
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,170
Where are all the young men?

665
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,200
They're all out for battle.

666
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:59,120
Only if they get a break from
war can they think of home, right?

667
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,250
Thank you.

668
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:06,980
You didn't go?

669
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,000
I've lived long, Sir...

670
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,330
Long enough to understand
that these wars and borders...

671
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,960
It's all just business.

672
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,960
What are you repairing these days?

673
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,380
Give us a job that befits a soldier, Sir.

674
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,130
We are here to fight the Pathans.

675
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,950
Not to build their mosques!

676
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,330
We'll fight when the time comes...

677
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,830
We surely will, Chanda Singh.

678
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,420
But now is the time to build God's home.

679
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,850
And we have no grudges with God, do we?

680
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,380
The Pathans wouldn't piss
on us if we were on fire, Sir.

681
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,420
We've been enemies since centuries.

682
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,580
We won't accept this, Sir.

683
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,450
You can give us any
punishment you deem fit.

684
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:56,670
This is service.

685
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,210
It must be done voluntarily, not by force.

686
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,500
Whosoever wishes,

687
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,170
can join me tomorrow morning.

688
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,710
But before you make up your mind...

689
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,800
Do remember the name of the person...

690
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:14,920
who laid the foundation stone
of the Sri Harminder Saheb Gurudwara.

691
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,130
Whoever laid it

692
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,470
how do we care?

693
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,580
Why bother thinking of it?

694
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,330
Right?

695
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,670
But who was it, after all?

696
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,710
The Sufi Muslim Saint, Hazrat Mian Mir.

697
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,920
Our Guru Arjan Dev Ji requested
him to do the honours.

698
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:49,290
May I battle all foes without fear.

699
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:58,030
And claim victory with courage.

700
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:05,690
May I battle all foes without fear.

701
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:13,150
And claim victory with courage.

702
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:22,460
And claim victory with courage

703
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:28,460
Grant me this boon, O God.

704
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:34,230
May I never refrain from righteous acts

705
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,860
Grant me this boon, O God.

706
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:47,690
May I never refrain from righteous acts.

707
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,190
You're late, Lal Singh!

708
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,290
Pardon my audacity, Sir -

709
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,770
but we're right on time!

710
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:35,860
If we were late,
you would be crushed to a pulp!

711
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,750
Come on, boys.

712
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,900
So, what needs to be done?

713
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,070
This way...

714
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:49,780
Slowly.

715
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,070
Straight, straight...

716
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,110
Yes...

717
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,100
Move it...

718
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:57,990
Okay.

719
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,500
Slowly.

720
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,180
Slowly.

721
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,710
Wait.

722
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,280
God bless you!

723
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,530
Daya Singh,

724
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,130
granny gave everyone an almond.

725
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,050
And everyone ate it.

726
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:30,000
But Bhola has been guarding
it like some prized possession!

727
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,340
We all crave for
something in life, Jeevan.

728
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,340
For some, it's power,
for some it's just respect.

729
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:38,380
Granny didn't just give him an almond,

730
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:40,000
she gave him respect, from the heart.

731
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:41,960
I don't quite understand.

732
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,460
In our society...

733
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:48,170
A man's caste dictates whether
he is treated as a human or animal.

734
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:52,130
And people like Bhola Singh
were always considered animals.

735
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,250
I was with him in Lahore.

736
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,880
I heard that as a child...

737
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,680
he once stole mangoes
from the landlord's orchard.

738
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,670
He paid the price,
with both his childhood...

739
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:06,210
and his mother's honour
crushed at the landlord's feet.

740
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:12,000
The truth is, our Gurus
always considered everyone equal.

741
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,960
But we as a society
never truly accepted this.

742
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,380
Baldev Singh!

743
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:39,800
Yes Sir!

744
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,650
Sir, there's a message from Lockhart.

745
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:48,890
What is it?

746
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,910
Sir, they're warning us.

747
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,610
A group of Pathans
is approaching Saragarhi.

748
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,300
He says they are sending troops for help.

749
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,210
Lal Singh.

750
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,460
Get me my monocular.

751
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,550
Yes Sir!

752
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,160
Why can't I see them?

753
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:26,710
Do you think they turned towards Gulistan?

754
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,590
It's possible.

755
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:33,830
Let's contact Gulistan, then.

756
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:03,780
There's a message from Lieutenant
Colonel Haughton, Sir.

757
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:14,700
Soldiers, there are at
least 10,000 of them out there.

758
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,490
And there's 21 of us.

759
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,900
Orders have arrived from Lockhart...

760
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:28,940
And a soldier's duty is to obey
his officer unquestioningly.

761
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,190
But...

762
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,190
But today I want you to
make this decision for yourselves.

763
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,570
What are Lieutenant Colonel
Haughton's orders, Sir?

764
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,400
They cannot come to help us.

765
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,380
Because the pathans
have blocked all the routes.

766
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,070
So they've asked us to
abandon the fort and escape.

767
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,690
Bhola, what's the matter?

768
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,650
They're asking us to run!

769
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,360
We should flee!

770
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:30,780
Soldiers!

771
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,410
I know how you feel about this.

772
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:40,270
But I still want you to think again.

773
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,420
You're putting a lot
more than your lives at risk.

774
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:52,400
So give it some more thought.

775
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,010
I always knew it...

776
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,440
A man who keeps preaching
love and humanity...

777
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:02,370
- How can he fight a war?
- Chanda Singh, you -

778
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,740
Why are you trying
to weaken our resolve, Sir?

779
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,740
Why don't you just admit...

780
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,110
That you're scared
seeing so many Pathans.

781
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,740
You don't want to
fight this battle, Sir!

782
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,820
I'll fight, Chanda Singh.

783
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,070
I most definitely will.

784
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:30,780
But I want us to first think...

785
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,330
what are we fighting for?

786
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:38,940
For the salaries
that we get every month...

787
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,070
For this uniform...

788
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:45,360
Or for the British
who are in fact, our oppressors?

789
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,610
Can you sacrifice everything
you have for them?

790
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,690
I cannot.

791
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,690
Absolutely not.

792
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:59,470
My life, relationships
and responsibilities...

793
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:01,730
are far more precious to me.

794
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,440
Then what will you fight for...

795
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:14,830
Sir?

796
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:20,280
Tell us!

797
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,580
- What nonsense is this, Chanda Singh?
- I'm speaking the truth, Sir!

798
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:57,810
I told you the very first day...

799
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,620
The British sent us a liability,
not a leader.

800
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,910
A man who goes around building
mosques for the Pathans...

801
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:03,450
Who will he fight for?

802
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:09,070
And you guys were happy
singing his praises!

803
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,450
Went ahead building
the Pathans' mosques...

804
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,780
Now see the result!

805
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:17,410
See for yourselves, what a coward he-

806
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,320
Do you know why I've
worn this saffron turban?

807
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,280
An Englishman once told
me - You're a slave.

808
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,200
That cowards are born in our country.

809
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,950
Today's the time to answer back.

810
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,900
Do you understand what
saffron symbolizes, Chanda Singh?

811
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,490
It's the colour of bravery.

812
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:35,700
Of sacrifice.

813
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,030
We've sacrificed millions of lives...

814
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:44,650
and earned the right
to wear this colour on our heads.

815
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,080
Today when I go to battle
thousands of enemies...

816
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,860
With my head decorated
and held up high...

817
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,570
I won't be alone.

818
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:58,900
I'll carry the spirit of all those
brave men who gave up their lives...

819
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:01,780
but not their honour.

820
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,400
Today I'll fight, not for money...

821
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,570
Not for the British...

822
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:12,150
Not for myself...

823
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,070
But for those martyrs.

824
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:20,530
For every man who
is considered a slave.

825
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,990
For my community.

826
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,740
Today I'll fight for my Guru...

827
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,200
Today, the turban I wear is Saffron...

828
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,820
I will bleed Saffron,

829
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,360
And my fight-back will also be Saffron!

830
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:41,360
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

831
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:47,430
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

832
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:53,890
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

833
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,990
There's just 21 of them!

834
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,650
Don't worry...

835
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,820
We're very far off.

836
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,110
The bullet can't reach here.

837
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:52,570
Sir...

838
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,550
I didn't know the gun
could fire that far!

839
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:56,990
It can.

840
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,600
If the wind blows
in the same direction.

841
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,350
Forces, get ready to attack!

842
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,560
Jeevan Singh, Uttam Singh.

843
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,690
Yes, sir!

844
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:32,640
36th Sikh!

845
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:35,140
Get into position!

846
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,600
What happened, Gurmukh?

847
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,350
Sir, I had a question.

848
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,700
Ask away.

849
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:54,310
I know Haughton Sir
ordered us to stay here.

850
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,020
Why did you lie to us?

851
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:00,560
For our freedom, Gurmukh.

852
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,710
Freedom, Sir?

853
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:05,520
The British call us slaves, Gurmukh.

854
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:12,200
A slave can neither live
nor die of his free will.

855
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:15,480
If I told you the truth...

856
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:20,560
It would be said that 21 soldiers
of the British army fought bravely.

857
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:24,890
But today these 21 Sikhs have
chosen to die of their own accord...

858
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:27,310
Not because a white
man ordered them to.

859
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:33,690
That's why today,
21 Sikhs shall fight as free men...

860
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:37,850
and die as free men.

861
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,510
Sir!

862
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,690
Yes, Khuda Daad.

863
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:55,390
You think I won't fight against them,
because I'm a Pathan?

864
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,600
When did I say so?

865
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,440
You said there's 10000 of them,
and 21 of us.

866
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,140
There's 22 of us, Sir!

867
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:04,560
I'll also fight.

868
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,060
Don't go by my stature.

869
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,440
I'm stronger than I look.

870
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,480
I can shoot as well.

871
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,060
Many people can shoot a gun,
Khuda Daad.

872
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:23,100
But the job I'm giving you,
is something only you can do.

873
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:24,310
What's that, Sir?

874
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,440
You'll offer water
to every wounded soldier.

875
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,560
But I've always done that.

876
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,950
But you've probably never
offered water to the enemy.

877
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:36,550
To enemy soldiers?

878
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,230
Till he fights, he's an enemy soldier.

879
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:43,480
When he falls wounded,
he's just a thirsty man.

880
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,690
Sir, I want to destroy our enemies,
not save them!

881
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:49,650
Daad...

882
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:54,270
In the battle of Anandpur Saab,
Bhai Kanhaiya Ji offered water...

883
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:57,600
to the injured Mughal
soldiers as well as the Sikhs.

884
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,690
When the Guru asked him why...

885
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,480
Do you know what he said?

886
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,060
What, Sir?

887
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:11,050
"I see God in all men, whether
it's our soldiers or theirs."

888
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:13,100
"How can I not serve Him?"

889
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,770
Fighting only destroys the enemy.

890
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,730
Kindness destroys enmity itself.

891
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:23,850
I'm giving you the chance to
be the bravest soldier in this battle.

892
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:26,510
If you have the courage, take it.

893
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:42,230
Bring it on.

894
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:04,140
Attack!

895
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,810
- After Saragarhi, they will attack here.
- Sir! It's started!

896
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:25,830
God help them.

897
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,850
Hold!

898
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:59,690
Today, either you'll screw
them or they'll screw you...

899
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,480
Either way,
your wedding night is guaranteed!

Fire!

01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,950
It's a bomb!

914
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,280
Bhagwan Singh!

915
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:15,830
Bhagwan Singh!

916
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:18,280
Nand Singh, lie low!

917
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:40,910
Screw you!

918
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,350
Nand Singh!

919
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,620
Bhagwan!

920
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,560
Nand Singh! Come on.

921
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,660
Stand up...

922
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:44,160
Bhagwan Singh!

923
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,370
Bhagwan...

924
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:50,860
Bhagwan...

925
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,620
No need...

926
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:57,620
No need to show such sympathy,
Nand Singh.

927
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:03,430
With the sad songs
you've been singing...

928
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:06,720
you won't survive either,
you idiot!

929
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:12,390
- Buddy...
- Yes.

930
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:15,810
My mother...

931
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:20,540
She will be left all alone, man!

932
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,600
Bhagwan...

933
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,080
Nand Singh.

934
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:39,430
Nand Singh!

935
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,460
Yes Sir!

936
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,100
Are you okay?

937
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:46,070
Yes Sir.

938
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,700
Go, handle the front.

939
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,780
The battle isn't over.

940
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:54,360
Those bloody...

941
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:09,150
Why didn't you shoot, Gurmukh Singh?

942
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:13,110
Why didn't you shoot, Gurmukh Singh!

943
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,400
Sir I...

944
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:17,530
You what?

945
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:19,780
What?

946
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
I...

947
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,200
I got scared, Sir!

948
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,320
I got scared.

949
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:28,950
I've never killed anyone.

950
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,380
Never fought a battle.

951
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:34,570
I got nervous, Sir.

952
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:48,950
Go take Bhagwan Singh inside,
and return to the Lamp.

953
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:53,070
And make sure Haughton Sir
is updated on every detail.

954
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,490
Go.

955
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:56,570
Yes Sir.

956
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,160
Sir...

957
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:05,450
There's a message from Saragarhi.

958
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,900
Bhagwan Singh has been martyred.

959
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:34,960
[BHAGWAN SINGH]

960
01:38:57,530 --> 01:38:58,860
Ram Singh!

961
01:38:59,300 --> 01:38:59,960
Yes Sir.

962
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,570
You take Bhagwan Singh's place.

963
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:04,120
But there'll be no one
left to guard the western front.

964
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,650
They'll get here only if
we let them cross from there.

965
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:07,450
Come on.

966
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:08,530
Yes, sir!

967
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:15,030
Destroy them in Bhagwan Singh's name!

968
01:39:36,490 --> 01:39:37,520
Cease fire.

969
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:39,820
Stop firing!

970
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:01,720
Sir.

971
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:02,960
Yes, Gurmukh.

972
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:06,360
Haughton Sir has said that General Biggs
has set off from Hangu with his batallion.

973
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:07,990
They'll reach by tomorrow.

974
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:13,790
Lal Singh!

975
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:16,140
This seems to be
a ruse of theirs, Sir.

976
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,150
We're just playing along, Lal Singh.

977
01:40:18,230 --> 01:40:19,230
How, sir?

978
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:22,120
General Biggs will arrive
with his forces tomorrow.

979
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:25,310
The longer this battle continues,
the better.

980
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:29,410
Now if they want to waste
time in talking, what's the harm?

981
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:33,150
So if we manage to stop them till
tomorrow, will they reach here to help us?

982
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,400
Even if they can't help us...

983
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:38,650
they'll be able to
help Gulistan and Lockhart.

984
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:42,270
The Pathans will definitely
attack there as well.

985
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:47,320
So the longer we can stop them,
the better it is for our comrades.

986
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,530
I'm Khan Masood.

987
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,210
The leader of the Afridis.

988
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,860
That's Gul Badshah,
the leader of the Orakzais.

989
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:27,530
And that's Mullah Saeedullah,
our guide.

990
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,990
That's Ram Singh.

991
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,320
Tell me.

992
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:35,810
Look, it's clear that
you cannot win this battle.

993
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:41,240
We won the moment we decided to fight.

994
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:45,910
The rest is mere bloodshed;
It will go on.

995
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,450
- None of you will...
- Wait, Sir.

996
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,420
Excuse me.

997
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,400
- Khuda Daad.
- Yes Sir.

998
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:06,490
You were saying something.

999
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:10,410
These antics of yours won't save you.

1000
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,990
You have only one chance to survive.

1001
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:15,410
Ask Allah for forgiveness, and leave.

1002
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,740
Or you'll get killed.

1003
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,780
We're ready, Sir.

1004
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:25,610
Do you have the courage
to die for your cause...

1005
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,680
Or can you only kill innocent women?

1006
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:16,820
If you lay down your arms,
we'll let you leave safely.

1007
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:22,070
There's a thin line
between bravery and madness.

1008
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:26,610
You got 10000 men to fight 21,
and you talk of bravery?

1009
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:14,360
If you want to fight, so be it.

1010
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,670
A dying man must be
granted his last wish.

1011
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,820
Fight bravely, Gul Badshah.

1012
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:21,700
The British are watching.

1013
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:26,240
Or they'll say cowards
are born from this land.

1014
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:28,780
You take great pride in your bravado,
isn't it?

1015
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:32,490
Well, our pride is
what we're fighting for.

1016
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:35,610
By noon today,
Your pride shall be destroyed.

1017
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:41,160
You'll fall at our feet
and beg for your lives.

1018
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:45,570
After Saragarhi, we'll have Gulistan
by afternoon and Lockhart by evening.

1019
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,950
Today we'll conquer all three forts...

1020
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:53,110
And the proud turbans of
the Sikhs will be at our feet.

1021
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,410
Dream on!

1022
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:07,740
Wait.

1023
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,780
Uttam Singh!

1024
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:27,740
You've lost a lot of men.

1025
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,860
You must be falling short.

1026
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:33,160
So I'm returning them to you.

1027
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,300
Move it!

1028
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:05,700
By the time the walls come down,
we should try and get to the doors.

1029
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:08,070
They are wooden -
they'll break quickly.

1030
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:10,740
The enemy won't survive
a two-pronged attack.

1031
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:13,990
That Sardar talks too much!

1032
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,320
We need to make him
realize our strength -

1033
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:31,570
Take that!

1034
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:49,860
Soldiers!

1035
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,780
They claim that...

1036
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:03,110
First Saragarhi,
Gulistan and by evening, Lockhart...

1037
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:07,780
They think that in 9 hours,

1038
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,240
they'll capture all three.

1039
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:19,770
They think that we'll fall
at their feet and beg for our lives.

1040
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:26,700
They think our turbans
will be crushed under their feet.

1041
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:31,210
What do you have to say to that?

1042
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,910
Screw you!

1043
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:44,240
Come down!

1044
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:46,200
Come down!

1045
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,090
Come down, my man...

1046
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:52,000
If the Pathans shoot,
you'll lose your manhood...

1047
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,010
along with your life!

1048
01:47:56,120 --> 01:48:00,840
I say, let's drop these British rifles,
and get our Indian shooters out!

1049
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:03,310
The enemy will flee
out of embarrassment!

1050
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:06,830
Someone shoot that infidel!

1051
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,990
36th Sikh!

1052
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:22,530
No matter what...

1053
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:26,000
we must stop them here till evening.

1054
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:34,050
Stay strong, brothers!

1055
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:54,680
Bhagwan Singh!

1056
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,800
Gurmukh!

1057
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:06,190
Gurmukh!

1058
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:42,780
Lal Singh!

1059
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,260
Yes Sir!

1060
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,100
Go down and guard the door!

1061
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,180
Now!

1062
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:49,740
Sunder, Daya, Hira, Jeevan, Bhola...

1063
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:50,820
Let's go!

1064
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:51,980
Let's go!

1065
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:01,360
Bhola!

1066
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:03,400
Bhola!

1067
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,860
Bhola!

1068
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:07,070
Bhola!

1069
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:11,110
Bhola!

1070
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:13,420
I was out of rounds, Sir...

1071
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,320
so they shot me down.

1072
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,430
Quiet, Bhola.

1073
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:17,900
Get a cloth from inside.

1074
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:19,890
Let it be, Sir.

1075
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:26,390
They say death washes away
all divisions and differences.

1076
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:27,950
Shut up, Bhola!

1077
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:29,030
Today,

1078
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:34,630
I feel like I'm truly equal...

1079
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,940
Sundar, get some cloth here, quick!

1080
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:38,440
Like everyone else.

1081
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:39,530
Bhola...

1082
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:41,520
Keep faith!

1083
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:43,440
It's okay...

1084
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:46,180
Stop it.

1085
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:47,260
Sir.

1086
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:03,060
Jeevan, you've become a fossil!

1087
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,860
Your Pop's a fossil!

1088
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,010
My rounds are over, Sir.

1089
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:32,270
Mine too!

1090
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:35,400
Sir, I also have only one left.

1091
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,400
What do we do?

1092
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:25,810
Bring the marksmen forward!

1093
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:28,940
Sundar!

1094
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:30,910
Heere!

1095
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:33,460
Jeevan! Take them inside...

1096
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,060
I'll collect the ammunition.

1097
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,690
Jeevan, close the door!

1098
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:35,270
Jeevan, close the door!

1099
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:23,990
Bhola...

1100
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:29,240
Shall I tell you a joke?

1101
02:00:49,370 --> 02:00:50,370
Sir...

1102
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:51,830
They're running out of bullets.

1103
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:53,410
It. Munn!

1104
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:54,410
Sir!

1105
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:55,950
They need more bullets.

1106
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:57,570
We've been trying, Sir.

1107
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,410
But the Pathans are too many.

1108
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:01,700
It's impossible to reach Saragarhi.

1109
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:13,910
Narayan, bring more bullets quickly!

1110
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:18,780
Go to hell!

1111
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:31,030
Narayan!

1112
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:28,290
Sir!

1113
02:06:28,370 --> 02:06:31,260
Two Pathans are trying
to blow up the west wall.

1114
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:22,690
Everything is over, Sir.

1115
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:24,770
The wall has fallen, Gurmukh...

1116
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:26,270
Not us.

1117
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:29,110
We need to stop them
for some more time.

1118
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:31,980
Go and take your
position at the Lamp.

1119
02:07:32,270 --> 02:07:35,730
And Chanda Singh,
you stay with Gurmukh.

1120
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:38,100
But Sir, I...

1121
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:40,570
This might be my last order,
Chanda Singh.

1122
02:07:43,310 --> 02:07:44,520
Accept it?

1123
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:51,070
Pass on a message from
me to Lawrence Sir, Gurmukh.

1124
02:07:51,150 --> 02:07:52,150
What, Sir?

1125
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,610
You know it well.

1126
02:07:57,940 --> 02:07:59,150
Yes Sir.

1127
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:02,860
Fill the flasks, Khuda Daad.

1128
02:08:03,650 --> 02:08:05,320
Our enemies will need it.

1129
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:06,400
Yes Sir.

1130
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:11,940
36th Sikh, any doubts?

1131
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:13,110
No, Sir!

1132
02:08:13,190 --> 02:08:13,910
Any doubts?

1133
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:15,270
NO SIR!

1134
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:21,270
Shut the door, Gurmukh!

1135
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:43,170
Sir.

1136
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:44,120
Tell me.

1137
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:47,320
The operator has sent you
a message from Havaldar Ishar Singh.

1138
02:08:48,170 --> 02:08:49,170
What is it?

1139
02:08:49,290 --> 02:08:51,680
"So long, Fakhar."

1140
02:08:56,190 --> 02:08:58,140
Finish off the remaining Sikhs,
quickly.

1141
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:02,560
There's still time...

1142
02:09:03,230 --> 02:09:05,580
We can conquer Gulistan.

1143
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:13,320
You won't come back this time,
will you Ishar?

1144
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:19,570
Who's going to look after your fields?

1145
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:22,370
You'll be there, won't you?

1146
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,490
And your mother?

1147
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:26,090
Who'll take care of her, my foot?

1148
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,770
You'll manage.

1149
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:29,840
I have full trust in you.

1150
02:09:30,270 --> 02:09:31,270
And what about me?

1151
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:36,270
You're my only support, Ishar.

1152
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:42,580
So should I leave
the fort and run away?

1153
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,760
Don't let our community down!

1154
02:10:10,230 --> 02:10:12,480
Attack!

1155
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:24,260
O Lord, protect our honour!

Didn't I tell you,
your turbans would be at our feet?

1178
02:18:30,110 --> 02:18:32,690
Dream on!

1179
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:40,510
Hold!

1180
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:47,520
Kill me if you want,

1181
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:51,060
but don't touch my turban.

1182
02:18:51,390 --> 02:18:53,430
No one will touch your turban.

1183
02:18:54,330 --> 02:18:56,140
I give you my word.

1184
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:02,760
What's your name?

1185
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:07,370
Ishar Singh.

1186
02:19:08,190 --> 02:19:10,620
I'll always remember you, Ishar Singh.

1187
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:54,760
I hope I didn't let us down, my love?

1188
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:39,260
Stay strong, brother.

1189
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:02,640
Damn, he sure was one tough nut to crack.

1190
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:07,510
We've lost the battle and the day,
Gul Badshah.

1191
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:11,010
It's going to be dark soon.

1192
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:15,070
It's impossible to reach
Gulistan and Lockhart now.

1193
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:20,540
I'm not going back
only carrying defeat...

1194
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:28,200
Do whatever you want, but
do not remove any Sikh's turban.

1195
02:21:38,310 --> 02:21:40,700
I want to hear that Sikh scream.

1196
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:44,490
Set the tower on fire.

1197

who says God is the ultimate truth!
